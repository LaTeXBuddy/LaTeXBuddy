`LatexBuddy` class got a major overhaul. Main takeaway: Instead of static
methods on the class we now resort to instance methods of a single `LatexBuddy`
instance. To get this instance, use `latexbuddy.buddy.get_instance()`.

Apart from that, `add_error()` was renamed to `add_problem()`.

Keep in mind that `LatexBuddy` will be changed later on; maybe even removed.
