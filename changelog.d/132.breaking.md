Instead of custom `subprocess.Popen()` wrappers, we use other public functions
of `subprocess` to run other tools. This introduces some breaking changes:

- `execute()`, `execute_background()`, and `execute_no_errors()` from the
  `tools` module got removed
- Python now controls the encoding used with your OS, which is usually UTF-8.
  Before this change, we would set it to ISO8859-1
