LaTeXBuddy
==========

| The only LaTeX checking tool you'll ever need.

LaTeXBuddy is the checking tool for LaTeX, which combines the power of various
other tools in one easy-to-use command-line tool with clear HTML output.
Aspell, ChkTeX, LanguageTool: you name it! LaTeXBuddy is modular and
Python-based, so that implementing new functionality becomes a breeze!


.. important::

   LaTeXBuddy is a **work in progress**. We are working on fixing bugs and cleaning up.
   Using LaTeXBuddy in its current state may come with a lot of inconveniences.
   Upon reaching the Beta status, we will open-source this project. For now, it technically
   remains copyrighted, yet you're free to fork it and provide your edits and
   improvements to the code base.
