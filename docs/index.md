# LaTeXBuddy

> The only LaTeX checking tool you'll ever need.

LaTeXBuddy is the checking tool for LaTeX, which combines the power of various
other tools in one easy-to-use command-line tool with clear HTML output.
Aspell, ChkTeX, LanguageTool: you name it! LaTeXBuddy is modular and
Python-based, so that implementing new functionality becomes a breeze!

:::{important}
LaTeXBuddy is a **work in progress**. We are working on fixing bugs and cleaning up.
Using LaTeXBuddy in its current state may come with a lot of inconveniences.
Upon reaching the Beta status, we will open-source this project. For now, it technically
remains copyrighted, yet you're free to fork it and provide your edits and
improvements to the code base.
