## Colour

The main palette consists of five colours. They were generated using the [OKLCH]
colour space.

The fixed parameters are chroma (0.072) and hue (196.09), the lightness goes
from 42% to 66% with the step size of 5. As such, the following colours are
generated:

- **LB42**\
  `oklch(42%, 0.072, 196.09)`\
  `#00595a`
- **LB48**\
  `oklch(48%, 0.072, 196.09)`\
  `#1d6a6b`
- **LB54**\
  `oklch(54%, 0.072, 196.09)`\
  `#327c7c`
- **LB60**\
  `oklch(60%, 0.072, 196.09)`\
  `#468e8e`
- **LB66**\
  `oklch(66%, 0.072, 196.09)`\
  `#59a0a1`

The accent colour for the light backgrounds is **LB42**, the accent colour for the light backgrounds is **LB48**. Each step represents the lighter version of the previous colour; the lighter colour can be used, for example, to colour the links on hover.

## Logos

![Logomark](https://gitlab.com/LaTeXBuddy/brand/-/raw/main/logo/logomark-light-bg.svg)

The logomark of LaTeXBuddy is an icon of a bird. It is the altered [`mdi:bird`][bird] icon from the [Material Design Icons] project. It was tilted, repainted, and the eye was removed.

The logomark contains four colours, which are **LB42** to **LB60** and **LB48** to **LB66** for light and dark backgrounds, respectively.

![Logotype](https://gitlab.com/LaTeXBuddy/brand/-/raw/main/logo/logotype-light-bg.svg)

The logotype consists of the logomark and the "LaTeXBuddy" type, set in the [Iosevka] font. The word "LaTeX" is typeset to look like the LaTeX project logo, that is, with a superset "A" and shifted down "E".

## Font

The font that is used in the logo is [Iosevka]. The websites use the system fonts.
